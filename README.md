# [SKATING CONFERENCE 2022]() (HTML-CSS-JS Microverse Capstone Project1)

The purpose of this project was to demonstrate mastery of HTML and CSS fundamentals, by conceptualizing and building an original website given specific [design](https://www.behance.net/gallery/29845175/CC-Global-Summit-2015) guidelines. The concept of the project is a SKATING CONFERENCE 2022 - the ultimate global skating conference.

I built this website with a mobile-first approach, applying fluid design principles -- It is fully-responsive across all breakpoints, from 320px up in all screens.
